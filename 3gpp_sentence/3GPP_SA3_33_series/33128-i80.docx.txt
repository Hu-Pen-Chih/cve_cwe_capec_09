service request.- New UE location due to tracking area updates or routing area updates.
When BBIFF is separated into BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U, these user plane packets are captured at the BBIFF-U.
In order to enable the BBIFF-U to do that function, the BBIFF-C triggers the BBIFF-U over the LI_T3 interface.
The second point is telling that the UE is an inbound roamer with Home Routed based roaming (with a specific DNN, if applicable).
The third point is telling that the PDU session is established for IMS services.
The fourth point is telling that the IMS signalling related QoS Flow is established.
If the received ActivateTask includes an APNs, the APN used for the PDN connection matches the one in the received ActivateTask.
The BBIFF-U/BBIFF The record that stores the SIP message is referred to as LI_X2_LITE_S record.
For IMS-based voice services, if media interception is required, the LMISF-IRI sends a trigger for the same to the BBIFF-C/BBIFF over the LI_T1 interface.
When the IMS session is completely released (e.g. all session-legs are released), the LMISF-IRI sends a trigger to the BBIFF-C/BBIFF to stop the media interception.
The "div" PASSporT with those identities in the "div" claim is not received in the SIP INVITE request from the S-CSCF.
- The "div" PASSporT with those identities in the "div" claim is received from the SIGNING AS.
Either IBCF or Telephony AS, is interacting with the VERIFICATION AS.
In both cases, the present document specifies the stage 3 for the LI_HI1, LI_HI2 and LI_HI3 interfaces.
This clause defines protocol and procedures to support the LI for IMS-based services.
A target non-local ID is identified distinctly through the provisioning.- IMPU.- PEIIMEI.When service scoping is applicable, additional target identities MCPTT ID for PTC).
The LI for redirected sessions in the VPLMN are handed as LI for session terminations.
This includes the LI for STIR/SHAKEN when signature is signed or verified in an IMS session involving a target as described in.
When service scoping applies, LI for voice-mail is provided if and only if "voice" service type is included as a part of LI provisioning.
IRI-POI/CC-TF IRI-POI/CC-TF stores (locally) the SIP Call Id to associate the subsequent SIP messages received on the same session for a target match.

The details of any needed interactions between those LI functions are not defined in the present document.
The enumerated value of "voice" or "messaging" in the service type field.
The enumerated value of "voice" or "messaging" in the service type field.
The E-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions when the target is registered for the emergency services.
The MGCF or IBCF provide the IRI-POI functions for such a case.
IMS user.- IMS session to a target is redirected to an outbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user.
- The-IRI-POI in the IMS signalling Functions meets the criteria mentioned infor providing the IRI-POI functions.
The CSP is required to send a notification to the LEMF when the media interception is required but not available for the interception.

An IMS session to a target is redirected to a user in the CS domain.
The H.248: Add Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP offer is handled.
In the latter case, the trigger to perform media interception is sent when the response SIP message is handled.
The H.248: Add Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP offer is handled.
This happens at the same time the first trigger (LI_T3 ActivateTask) is sent.
The DeactivateTask message(s) that the CC-TF sends to the CC-POI - Media interception of an IMS session ends.
If two LI_T3 ActivateTask messages were used (asymmetric media stream case), then two LI-T3 DeactivateTask messages are required.
The two triggers provide the information necessary to identify the media in two directions of the media flow.
When the CC-TF is aware of this, it would have used the value "NotDetermined" as the PayloadDirectionAssignment field.
The CC-POI The CC-POI Clause 7.12.6.2 describes how the CC-POI identifies the incoming and outgoing media packets.
The RemoteSDP address provides the SDP information (e.g. codec information) expected by the remote end of the media flow.
The media packets sent to that remote end of the media flow are based on this SDP information.
In this case, the LIPF The MDF and LEMF perform protocol level correlation between intercepted signalling and media.
LI_T3 ensures that the SDP in the intercepted SIP signalling or in LI_X3 matches the IP/UDP destination IP-address and port for every intercepted RTP stream.
The RCS server receives a SIP SUBSCRIBE request from a target’s contact with the Event header set to "presence.winfo".
