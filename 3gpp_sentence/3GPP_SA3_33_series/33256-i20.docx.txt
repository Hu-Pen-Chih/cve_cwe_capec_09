A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 .A2X: as defined in.
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905and the following apply.
The UAV is authenticated based on the CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID.
The AMF initiated Re-authentication procedure is described in the clause 5.2.1.2, whereas the USS initiated Re-authentication procedure is described in the clause 5.1.2.4.1.
For an AMF initiated re-authentication, the procedure starts from the step 2.
The UAS NF resolves the USS address based on CAA-Level UAV ID or uses the provided USS address.
Only authorized USS The UAS NF sends an Authentication Request to the USS.
The USS replies to UAS NF with the Authentication Response message.
The UAS NF sends the transparent container received in 4a to the AMF with the GPSI.4f.
The SMF triggers a UUAA procedure after the determination in step 7 in the clause 5.2.1.1.
The USS replies to UAS NF with the Authentication Response message.
The UE responses the AMF with an Authentication message embedded in a transparent container over a NAS MM transport message.
The USS sends a re-authentication request for the UAV to UAS-NF that includes GPSI, CAA-Level UAV ID, and an authentication message.
It The USS The UAS NF determines whether the target NF is an AMF or an SMF.
If the target NF is an AMF, the UAS NF further determines the target AMF for re-authentication and continues step 3a.
If the target NF is an SMF, the UAS NF further determines the target SMF for re-authentication and continues step 3b.1.
The UE's context contains identity mapping between the GPSI and the USS identifier that performed UUAA.
The target NF (i.e., the target AMF or the target SMF) 3c.
The UAS NF responds back to the USS indicating that authorization revocation request has been successfully initiated as inand the UAS NF 4a.
An UAV is allowed to perform UUAA with the USS/UTM only after the UAV (UE) has completed successfully authentication with EPC.
The UAV is authenticated based on the CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID.
The SMF+PGW-C decides to trigger the UUAA procedure as described in.
The SMF+PGW-C forwards the transparent container to the UE over NAS MM transport messages.
The UE response to the SMF+PGW-C with an Authentication message embedded in a transparent container over a NAS MM transport message.
NOTE 2: The method of transporting messages between the SMF+PGW-C and UE is described in.
The below description considers only the security related parameters (for full details of the flows see).
The UE's context contains identity mapping between the GPSI and the USS identifier that performed UAA.
The UE's context contains identity mapping between the GPSI and the USS identifier that performed UUAA.
The UAS NF responds back to the USS indicating that authorization revocation request has been successfully initiated as inand the UAS NF 5.
The UAS NF/NEF first verifies the request in step 1 is authorized.
On the condition of the location services provided by AMF, the UE presence status is provided by reusing the Area of Interest mechanism.
The UAS NF/NEF provides the UAV(s) location information or presence to the USS.
When the UAV needs a new dedicated PDU session for connectivity to the UAV-C, the UE initiates a PDU Session Establishment procedure.
When the UE wants to use an existing PDU session for connectivity to the UAV-C, the UE initiates a PDU Session Modification procedure.
The pairing information includes the CAA-level UAV IDs of the requesting UAV and identification information of UAV-C to pair.
It is performed by the USS, and is not in scope of2.
The SMF invokes the authorization procedure with the USS via UAS-NF.
The USS informs the SMF via the UAS NF of the authorization results.
When the UAV needs a new dedicated PDU session for connectivity to the UAV-C, the UE initiates a PDN Connection Session Establishment procedure.
When the UAV needs to use an existing PDN connection for connectivity to the UAV-C, the UE initiates a PDN Connection Modification procedure.
The pairing information includes the CAA-level UAV IDs of the requesting UAV and identification information of UAV-C to pair.
It is performed by the USS, and is not in scope of2.
The USS informs the SMF+PGW-C via the UAS NF of the authorization results.
The UAV pairing authorization can be revoked by the USS at any time.
Besides, the paired UAV-C can be replaced by a new UAV-C by the USS at any time.
Unicast mode A2X Direct Communication is used by two UEs that directly exchange traffic for the A2X applications running between the peer UEs.
This clause specifies the security requirements and the procedures of the Remote ID broadcast communication.
